    <h1>Ejercicio 23</h1>

    <p id="parrafo">
        Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.. Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease!
        Now come out before somebody sees you. Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there! I'm going to regret this. There goes
        another one. Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited. That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here. Are you
        sure this things safe? Close up formation. You'd better let her loose. Almost there! I can't hold them! It's away! It's a hit! Negative. Negative! It didn't go in. It
        just impacted on the surface. Red Leader, we're tight above you. Turn to point.. oh-fice, we'll cover for you. Stay there.. Y just lost my starboard engine. Get
        set to make your attack run. The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with
        those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah.... This is a consular ship. Where on a diplomatic mission. If this is a consular ship... were is the
        Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship and apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive! There she is! Ser for stun! She'll
        be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner. What a piece of junk. She'll make point fice beyond the speed of light. She may not look kie much, but
        she's got it where counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here. Hello, sir.
